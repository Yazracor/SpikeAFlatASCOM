    <h1>Spike-A-Flat ASCOM driver readme</h1>
    Thanks for installing. The driver should "just work" with the Spike-A-Flat USB dimmer with 32-bit or 64-bit host applications. Its only settings are "tracing" for debuggin and you can select if the panel shut automatically turn off when disconnected by the application.
