    <h1>Spike-A-Flat ASCOM driver readme</h1>
    Thanks for installing. The driver should "just work" with the Spike-A-Flat USB dimmer with 32-bit or 64-bit host applications. It currently does not check if there are several of theses dimmers attached and will just select the first one available. The only relevant setting is used to choose if you want the driver to shut down the panel on disconnect.
